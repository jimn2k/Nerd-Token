# Nerd Token
 A token for tracking nerds

Based on [nft_erc721 by dappuniversity](github.com/dappuniversity/nft_erc721).

## Changelog

### v 0.0.1

- Commit after passing tests.
- Updated base contract for OpenZeppelin v3.

## Goal

Nerd Tokens should track nerds using `Counters.Counter _nerdometer` and assign a `string memory tokenURI` based on whatever the nerds feel like.

The main branch will be mostly reserved for necessary features, since this project is primarily meant for hacking together serialized NFTs.
